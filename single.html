								<a href="https://imbizo.africa/" style= "color:#9adbf4">IBRO-Simons Computational Neuroscience Imbizo </a> summer school, which takes place in Noordhoek, Cape Town, South Africa, brings together African and multinational students, academic instructors, and teaching assistants to share expertise and acquire new knowledge. The school is designed for students who are finishing their master's degrees and early doctorate students with a variety of STEM-related backgrounds.
								The core concepts of computational and theoretical neuroscience as well as practical exercises in simulation are taught to students. In order for the students to become familiar with the principles being taught, teamwork was encouraged. These lectures are offered by experts in the field, and students are given a short-term hand on a project of their choice that is supervised by the teaching assistants which is presented at the end of the schoool.</p>
								<p>I participated as a student and the research project I worked on focused on reinforcement learning, which is concerned with the relationships that develop over time between an agent and their environment.
									It can be used to solve a wide range of issues, including robotics, navigation, and market analysis. The purpose of this study was to investigate how various reinforcement learning approaches act in a given environment. I created a model-based agent and a model-free agent, each of which employs a unique method for making predictions and determining what is good or bad. Then, I contrast these two approaches.
									I then visualized how each of these agents acts because they all act differently in a complicated environment.
   This finding demonstrated that reinforcement learning can be used in other contexts to better comprehend complicated developing systems.
   This project was under the supervision of  <a href="https://annikc.github.io/" style= "color:#9adbf4">Dr. Annik Yalnizyan-Carson </a>.

   <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/turtle pic.jpeg" alt=""  width="600" 
	height="300" /></span>The adage "All work and no play makes Jack a lazy boy" is true. After finishing our lessons and projects, we try to relax by playing educational games that teach us something as well as being entertaining.
	On certain days, in addition to touring Cape Town's lovely township, we also go swimming at a tidal pool to unwind. We go out to eat at restaurants on certain nights, and on other nights, we head to the bar for a few drinks and a pub quiz.
   <p>Despite the intense learning environment,students are encouraged to interact with faculty members and one another. Additionally, feedback is welcomed, and we are counseled to focus on the process rather than the outcome in order to learn from it.
Imbizo experience is indeed an unforgetable.

								<p>AIMS-Ghana is a non-profitable organization that train students from various African countries in STEM-related fields. Every student is encouraged at AIMS Ghana to challenge themselves to learn outside of their comfort zones and to use analytical thinking in problem-solving-focused courses.
									Since AIMS believes that the next Einstein would likely come from Africa and be a woman, they make every effort to enlist the help of academicians from prominent institutions throughout the world to train their student and provide them with the highest academic knowledge possible.</p>
									I was one of the 47 African students chosen out of over 500 candidates. Being one among the chosen few inspires me with pride and confidence. My exposure to AIMS has introduced me to  courses in entrepreneurship, computing, quantum physics, pure and applied mathematics and climate science.  I   have valued the enlargement of my knowledge that these courses have provided.
								I graduated from AIMS in June 2022, and my time there was both insightful and labor-intensive. Because I was taking courses outside of my comfort zone, the I can do attitude kept me moving forward in AIMS. This type of training taught me that if you put in more effort and don't give up on a regular basis, you can fulfill your objectives.

									Fast forward teamwork was strongly encouraged, and scientific discussions were held with alumni and experts from various fields. 
									Not to mention the extracurricular activities and socialization that were planned to help us decompress after all of our hard work.
								<p>Fun fact about me: after two weeks of teaching and learning, I felt things were getting difficult and wanted to go home because I felt I wasn't in the right place since the courses I was taking was outside my comfort zone.
								Today, I am grateful to myself for not making such a decision. It was absolutely worth the stay, and I thank the AIMS organizers for providing such an excellent opportunity for young African students to gain knowledge and broaden their fields of study.  
								AIMS is indeed a place to call home.
